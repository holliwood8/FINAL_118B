    "# Abstract \n",
    "Our project aims at facilitating the process of finding and segmenting brain tumors from MRI imaging. For our data we will unify 3 data sets from 3 iterations of the 'Brain Tumor Segmentation' challenge.The data sets in question are BRATS2020, BRATS2019, BRATS2018. These data represent a collection of 3D MRI scans collected over 3 years. The following is measured in the data set: native scans (T1) and post-contrast T1-weighted (T1Gd) scans T2-weighted (T2) scans, and T2 Fluid Attenuated Inversion Recovery (T2-FLAIR) volumes. We will utilize Fuzzy C-Means clustering for tumor segmentation. We will rely on Silhouette Score, Davies-Bouldin Index, Calinski-Harabasz Index, Adjusted Rand Index and Normalized Mutual Information as our metrics to measure performance of our model."

    "Brain tumor segmentation is a long-standing challenge in the medical field: the development of accurate and efficient techniques to detect brain tumors from medical imaging such as MRI (magnetic resonance imaging) would make diagnosis more accessible and facilitate prompt treatment. \n",
    "\n",
    "Historically, brain tumor segmentation has been based on simple yet effective threshold techniques, where an intensity value is selected as threshold, and voxels (3-dimensional pixels) with higher intensity are marked as tumor tissue<a name=\"threshold\"></a>[<sup>[1]</sup>](#threshold).\n",
    "\n",
    "In recent years the development of neural networks has improved the accuracy of MRI tumor detection. One well-performing family of architectures are Convolutional Neural Networks, in which an MRI image is convolved with several kernels, allowing for the detection of tumor-like features and ultimately the segmentation of the tumor itself<a name=\"CNN\"></a>[<sup>[2]</sup>](#CNN). Critically, CNNs must be trained on labeled data, hence they require the manual expert segmentation of brain tumors. Given that a large dataset is essential for optimal training, the need for manually segmented images represents a drawback of this architecture.   \n",
    "\n",
    "Even more accurate brain tumor segmentation is achieved though the SOTA technique of U-NETs, developed by Olaf Ronnenberg and colleagues in 2015 for medical imaging segmentation<a name=\"U-NET\"></a>[<sup>[3]</sup>](#U-NET). U-NET architectures harness an encoding path (for downsampling, similar to a CNN) and a decoding path (for upsampling, through successive convolutions and upsampling operations) to precisely localize tumors with limited datasets, which is revolutionary for the field and a leap from traditional CNNs<a name=\"3DU-NET\"></a>[<sup>[4]</sup>](#3DU-NET).\n",

    "# Problem Statement\n",
    "\n",
    "This project is aimed at tackling the problem of automatic brain tumor semantic segmentation from medical imaging. More specifically, given a high-resolution (1x1x1mm) MRI image of the brain, we aim at identifying each and all the voxels that belong to the tumor, assigning them a label of 1 (tumor) or 0 (non-tumor). This task is relevant to machine-learning, as it involves clustering algorithms and neural-network-based solutions."

    "# Proposed Solution\n",
    "\n",
    "For our solution we will utilize Fuzzy C-Means. Soft clustering will allows us to assign voxels to multiple classes with varying degrees of membership. This apporach seemlessly pairs with our data set, since the data set provides us with a variety of high-resolution 3D scans. We will rely mostly on a Python implementation using scikit-fuzzy. The data will be pre-processed using Nilearn, an MRI-specific python library. The C-Means model will output the segmented version of the brain volume. This will be a mask in which each voxel has assigned a value corresponding to the probability of it being tumor tissue. We will evaluate the segmentation by keeping track of a few key metrics: Silhouette Score, Davies-Bouldin Index, Calinski-Harabasz Index, Adjusted Rand Index and Normalized Mutual Information.\n",
    "\n",
    "The algorithm itself consists of the following steps:\n",
    "\n",
    "Initialization - Here we choose the number of clusters and initialize cluster centers.\n",
    "\n",
    "Membership Assignment - Here we calculate the probability of each voxel belonging to each cluster.\n",
    "\n",
    "Cluster Center Update - Here we calculate the updated weights, so that the centers represent the mean feature of the cluster.\n",
    "\n",
    "Iteration - Perform the previous 2 steps until changes in clusters are below a certain threshold.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Post-processing - Perform the segmentation and generate the output."

    "\n",
    "**Silhouette Score** - assesses the cohesion and separation of the clusters. The score is assigned in the range -1 (incorrect clustering) to 1 (highly dense clustering), where a higher value indicates a better performance of the algorithm. For each point $i$, the silhouette score is defined as:   $s(i) = \\frac{b(i) - a(i)}{\\max{a(i), b(i)}}$.   \n",

    "- $a(i)$ is the mean distance between point $i$ and all other points in the same cluster, and \n",
    "- $b(i)$ is the mean distance of $i$ to all points in the nearest cluster.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Davies-Bouldin Index** - this index measures the ratio between within-cluster scatter to between-cluster separation, where lower values are better since they indicate more concentrated far-apart clusters. The Davies-Bouldin index is defined as: \n",
    "$DB = \\frac{1}{k} \\sum{i=1}^{k} \\max{j \\neq i} \\left( \\frac{\\sigma_i + \\sigma_j}{d(c_i, c_j)} \\right)$  \n",

    "- $d(c_i, c_j)$ is the distance between any 2 means $c_i$ and $c_j$.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Calinski-Harabasz Index** - this index measures the the ratio between the sum of between-clusters dispersion to within-cluster dispersion, where higher values are better indicating more cluster separation. The Calinski-Harabasz Index is defined as:\n",
    "$CH = \\frac{B_k / (k - 1)}{W_k / (N - k)}$  \n",

    "- $W_k$ is the dispersion matrix within cluster k\n",
    "- $k$ is the number of clusters\n",
    "\n",
    "**Adjusted Rand Index** - this index measures the difference between the ground truth and model outcome, where values range from -1(random labeling) to 1(correct labeling). The adjusted rand index is defined as: $ARI = \\frac{RI - Expected_RI}{Max_RI - Expected_RI}$  \n",
    "- $RI$ is the Rand Index \n",
    "- $Expected_RI$ is the expected Rand Index of random labeling,\n",
    "- $Max_RI$ is the maximum Rand Index value.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "**Normalized Mutual Information** - a normalized value, which quantifies the amount of information obtained about one random variable through another, where values range from 0(no mutual information) to 1(perfect correlation).The Normalized Mutual Information (NMI) between two clusterings (U) and (V) is calculated as: $NMI(U, V) = \\frac{2 \\cdot I(U, V)}{H(U) + H(V)}$\n",
